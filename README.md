# Introduction

I recognized that staff was repeating certain tasks on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. I used python to automate a majority of this work. I saved 1000+ hours of work over the life of the script. 

## Script Overview

The Python automation script is written to accomplish hourly, daily, and monthly report reviews. It recognizes common issues, makes corrections, or notifies the employee. The script interacts with the Emergency Reporting API and JotForm.com.
